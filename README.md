# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
- Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
- Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation üìö
- Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
- Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
- Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
- Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do ‚Äî the specific features and actions that enable users to achieve their goals within the booking management platform.
Examples (Hotel Booking Management System):
- User Registration & Authentication:
Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage profiles using email, phone, or social logins (e.g., Google).
  
- Search & Filter Listings:
Users can search hotels or apartments by location, price range, amenities, and available dates.

- Booking Management:
Users can view property details, check availability, and confirm bookings with specified check-in/check-out dates.

- Payment Processing:
The platform supports multiple payment gateways (cards, PayPal, wallet) for secure transactions.

- Cancellation & Refund:
Users can cancel bookings based on hotel policy, and refunds are processed automatically.

- Host Dashboard:
Property owners can add, edit, or remove listings, update prices, and monitor booking statistics.

- Notification System:
Booking confirmations, reminders, and updates are sent via email or SMS.

- Review & Rating System:
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after completing their stay.

# üîí Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify how the system performs ‚Äî focusing on the quality, reliability, and user experience aspects of the platform.
Examples (Hotel Booking Management System):

- Performance:
The application should support up to 10,000 concurrent users with average response times under 2 seconds.

- Scalability:
The system architecture should allow horizontal scaling as user and property data grow.

- Availability:
Maintain 99.9% uptime to ensure continuous booking access.

- Security:
Encrypt user data and transactions using SSL/TLS, and apply OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

- Usability:
Design should be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

- Reliability:
Ensure consistent data integrity across distributed systems, even during service interruptions.

- Maintainability:
Use modular code and clear documentation to simplify updates and bug fixes.

- Backup & Recovery:
Perform daily automated backups with recovery time objectives (RTO) under 15 minutes.

# User Case Diagrams
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system to accomplish specific goals. It captures the system‚Äôs functional requirements and defines the relationships between users and use cases (system functionalities).

# Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Provide a high-level overview of system interactions.
- Help identify functional requirements early in the design process.
- Enhance communication between stakeholders and developers.
- Serve as a blueprint for creating detailed user stories and test cases.
- Make the system easier to analyze, design, and validate.

# ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a feature or functionality must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They help ensure that the development team delivers a solution that aligns with user expectations, business goals, and technical standards.

In Requirement Analysis, acceptance criteria play a vital role by:
- Defining the scope of a user story or feature.
- Providing clarity to developers, testers, and stakeholders on what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means.
- Serving as a basis for testing, ensuring that each requirement can be verified.
- Reducing misunderstandings between the business team and developers.
- Supporting traceability between requirements, design, and testing phases.

# Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

User Story:
As a guest, I want to securely complete my booking payment so that I can confirm my reservation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The user must be able to review booking details (dates, price, property name) before payment.
- The system should display available payment options (credit/debit card, PayPal, or wallet).
- When the user confirms payment, the system must process the transaction through a secure payment gateway.
- If the payment is successful, the user should receive a confirmation message and email containing the booking details.
- If the payment fails, the system should display an error message and allow the user to retry or select another payment method.
- The booking record should only be created after successful payment confirmation.
- The system must log each payment transaction with a unique transaction ID.
- The checkout process should be completed within 10 seconds under normal network conditions.
